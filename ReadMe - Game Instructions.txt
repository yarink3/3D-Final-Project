Hello and wellcome to our snake game!

When you will open the application you will see a snake with some floating sphres, try to catch them.

The screen is splitted to 2, the left side is the top camera, and the right side is a vision from the snake's eyes. 

Each yellow sphre you catch you will get 5 more points,
lookout from the green ones, catching them will reduce your score by 5 points.

In each level you have 90 seconds to reach 25 points.
When you finish the game you will be questioned if you want to preceed to the next level(n), begin a new game(B) , or quit (Q).

we hid some cheats in order to make it easier for you to finish the levels and the game, do you think you can guess them?

Good luck!
